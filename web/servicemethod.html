    <!--    Service() method in HttpServlet-->
    <h1>The service() Method <br></h1>
    <p>
        The service() method is the main method to perform the actual task.<br>
        The servlet container (i.e. web server, Tomcat in this case) calls the service() method to handle requests coming from the client(browser)<br>
        and to write the formatted response back to the client.<br>

        Each time the server receives a request for a servlet,<br>
        the server spawns a new thread and calls service.<br>
        The service() method checks the HTTP request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)<br>
        and calls doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete, etc. methods as appropriate.</p>

    <h3>    public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {<br>
             // code here<br>
            }
    </h3>
    <br>
    <form action = "add">
        <p>The service() method overrides the doGet() method or doPost() method or both.<br> By default in HTML form its a  get method.</p>
        &lt;form action = "add"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;<br>
