    <h1>Implicit Objects in JSP</h1>
    When we write JAVA code in JSP some objects that we had to create in Servlets will automatically be created in JSP<br>
    These are some builtin objects that can be used within JSP tags- <br>
    1. request (HttpServletRequest)
    2. response (HttpServletResponse)
    3. out (PrintWriter object)
    4. session (HttpSession)
    5. application (ServletContext)
    6. config (ServletConfig)
