    <h1>Implicit Objects in JSP</h1>
    When we write JAVA code in JSP some objects that we had to create in Servlets will automatically be created in JSP<br>
    These are some builtin objects that can be used within JSP tags- <br><br>
    1. request (HttpServletRequest)<br>
    2. response (HttpServletResponse)<br>
    3. out (PrintWriter object)<br>
    4. session (HttpSession)<br>
    5. application (ServletContext)<br>
    6. config (ServletConfig)<br>
